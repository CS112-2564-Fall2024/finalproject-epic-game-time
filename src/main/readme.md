Name of project: Timor 

My project I decided to build a endless dungeon crawler. I would consider these my go to genre of games 
so I wanted to take a try at making one. The theme of my game is drawn from inspirations such as Berserk, Fear and Hunger 
, and Darkest Dungeon. The goal of my game is to try and reach the farthest room possible with enemies in your way
that attack you.
